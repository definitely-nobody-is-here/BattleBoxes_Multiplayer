# BattleBoxes_Multiplayer
BattleBoxes, but it's multiplayer! Large maps and free-for-all playing!

***

### Installation
I cannot distribute node.js as I do not own any rights to it, but visiting [their website](https://nodejs.org/) you can download the latest (not LTS) and install it, **checking the box "Automatically install necessary tools"**. Wait for the installation to finish, then [download the code](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/BattleBoxes_Multiplayer/archive/master.zip) and unzip it into any folder. Run Config.bat or Config.sh (depending on system).Then simply double-click on Start.bat or Start.sh and the server is running!
Or, you can run the .pkg file included. However, I have no idea how to use it so you'll have to figure it out for yourself.

To stop the server, type "stop" into the server console.

### Joining the Game
Once the server is started, you can find your computer's name (available in Windows>System>About as "Device name"), or simply search [what's my ip](http://google.com/search?q=whats+my+ip) or click the link. The server console will tell you what port to visit and you can type either the ip address or computer name on the client side **connected to the same network as the host** and then followed by a ":" and then the port number. Example: 111.22.33.444:2000 or hostcomputer:1100
